## Other resources

The books I listed are mostly theoretical. But for the computational homeworks you may need the following:

1. M. Kirk, *Thoughtful Machine Learning with Python*.
2. C. O'Neil, R. Schutt, *Doing Data Science*.
4. J. VanderPlas, *Python Data Science Handbook*.

Also, there are excellent resources on the web. I would recommend:

* edX: `https://edx.org`
* MIT-X: `https://openlearning.mit.edu`
* Kaggle Courses on [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python), [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas), [Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization), [Data cleaning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning), and [GIS Data](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/geospatial-analysis).

Enroll to any of the data, machine learning, statistics, R or python classes that catches your fancy, or you think might be useful for you.

## A sample of data sources

* [UCI datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)
* [Google dataset explorer](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory)
* [Registry of open datasets on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/)
* [Open MRI, MEG, EEG, iEEG, and ECoG data](https://openneuro.org/)
* [NCBI datasets](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/)
* [Open GIS data](https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/gis-data)
* [NASDAQ data](https://data.nasdaq.com/search)

## Technical Requirements

The course is an applied data analysis class.  This means the course requires a degree of proficiency of computational tools from which you are going to be responsible.

* [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language (version 3.10 or higher)
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) package managers
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook system
* [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language

Installing and maintaining these systems on your machine is your responsibility. I can't help you if something doesn't work. You will need to figure it out on your own.  If you can't install these systems on your machine you may try to use an online service:

* [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) 
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/notebooks-at-microsoft/)

## Course Management

I will make all of the course related announcement on İTÜ's course management system [NINOVA](https://ninova.itu.edu.tr). I will post the grades on NINOVA as well. So, do check it regularly.

# E-Mail Policy

I receive approximately 50 e-mails per day. So, if you need to contact me, use the subject ``MAT388E'' in your e-mails. Spend some time structuring your e-mail with grammatically correct sentences in Turkish or in English. Be polite, direct, and concise. State what you need in the first two sentences.  Sign your e-mails with your name and student number. If I can't figure out who you are and what you need within 30 seconds of opening your message, I will delete your e-mail with no response. You are hereby warned.
